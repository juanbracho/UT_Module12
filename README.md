NoSQL Databases with MongoDB

## Overview

This module dives into the use of NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, for managing and analyzing unstructured data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB offers greater flexibility with JSON-like documents, making it suitable for projects that involve dynamic or hierarchical data.

## Project: UK Food Standards Agency Database Analysis

### Part 1: Database Setup
1. Imported data from `establishments.json` into a local MongoDB database named `uk_food`.
2. Connected to the database using PyMongo and confirmed the setup by:
   - Listing all databases and collections.
   - Displaying a sample document using `find_one()`.

### Part 2: Updating the Database
- Added a new halal restaurant entry to the database.
- Updated the `BusinessTypeID` field for the new restaurant.
- Removed all establishments in Dover.
- Converted string fields (e.g., `latitude`, `longitude`, and `RatingValue`) into appropriate numerical formats.

### Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
- Answered key questions to help "Eat Safe, Love" identify suitable establishments:
  1. Found establishments with a hygiene score of 20.
  2. Identified establishments in London with a `RatingValue` â‰¥ 4.
  3. Retrieved the top 5 establishments near "Penang Flavours" with the lowest hygiene scores.
  4. Aggregated data to rank Local Authority areas by the number of establishments with a hygiene score of 0.
